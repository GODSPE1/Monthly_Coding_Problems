# Daily Coding Problems

## Description

This repository is dedicated to solving one coding problem each day. The problems can range from Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to language-specific challenges. The goal is to consistently practice and improve problem-solving skills across various domains.

## Goals

- Solve one coding problem daily.
- Explore different problem types (DSA, language-specific, etc.).
- Improve coding proficiency and problem-solving abilities.
- Maintain a log of solved problems.

## Structure

The repository can be structured by month and then by day, or by problem type. For example:

```
Monthly_Coding_Problems/
├── YYYY-MM/
│   ├── YYYY-MM-DD_ProblemName/
│   │   ├── solution.[language_extension]
│   │   └── README.md (Problem description, approach, and learnings)
├── DSA/
│   ├── Arrays/
│   │   ├── ProblemName/
│   │   │   ├── solution.[language_extension]
│   │   │   └── README.md
├── Language_Specific/
│   ├── Python/
│   │   ├── ProblemName/
│   │   │   ├── solution.py
│   │   │   └── README.md
└── README.md
```

## How to Contribute (Optional)

If you\'d like to contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your problem (`git checkout -b feature/YYYY-MM-DD_ProblemName`).
3. Solve the problem and add your solution with a corresponding README.md.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m \'Add solution for YYYY-MM-DD_ProblemName\'`).
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YYYY-MM-DD_ProblemName`).
